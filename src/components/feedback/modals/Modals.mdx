# Modals
Modal components use the `react-modal` npm package.
- [`<Modal />`](?path=/story/components-feedback-modals-modal--playground)
  - Used in flows without user interaction.
  - **Example:** after a transaction is successful or fails a Modal opens with the result.
- [`<ModalButton />`](?path=/story/components-feedback-modals-modalbutton--playground)
  - Used the majority of the time when we need a modal to pop up when a user clicks something (a button)
  - **Example:** when the preferences icon in the navbar is clicked a modal pops up containing .

# ModalButton
`<ModalButton>` opens a modal when clicked. It is based on `<Modal />`.
* `title` is the title of the modal.
* `renderButton` is the button that opens the modal. It is a function that takes an `open` boolean and returns a JSX element.

## Imports
```tsx
import ModalButton, { ModalButtonProps } from '@terra-station-ui/components/feedback';
```

## Simple Example:
You can use `<ModalButton>` to display a [`<Button />`](?path=/docs/components-general-button--docs) that opens the modal.
```jsx
  <ModalButton
    title='Modal Title'
    renderButton={(open) => (
      <Button onClick={open}>Open Modal</Button>
    )}
  >
    {**children**}
  </ModalButton>
```

## Complex Example:
This more complex example of how the Modal opeerates with other components.
In this example, `renderButton` is passed [`<Input />`](?path=/docs/components-form-components-input--docs) which has an `actionButton` that gets `open` from `renderButton` as its `onClick` prop.
```jsx
  <ModalButton
    title='Modal Title'
    renderButton={(open) => (
      <Input
        {...register("recipient")}
        placeholder={SAMPLE_ADDRESS}
        actionButton={{
          icon: <ContactsIcon />,
          onClick: open,
        }}
        autoFocus
      />
    )}
  >
    {**children**}
  </ModalButton>
```
